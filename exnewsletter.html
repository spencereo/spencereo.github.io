            I finished reading Ted Chiang's Exhalation, a collection of science fiction short stories, last month and
            Min
            Jin Lee's Pachinko, which will probably my biggest and favorite read of 2020.

            <a href="https://goodbye.substack.com/p/from-911-to-45-how-will-we-remember">Time to Say Goodbye</a> has
            been my go-to podcast for the last couple months now.
            Asian American journalists and academics talk about current events. I don't want to call it the voice of
            reason, but this show has really challenged my understanding of progressive action, my identity, and my role
            in society. This week's listener question especially resonated with me.

            Here's a 2019 article on how <a

            Learning about radical politics and social movements while starting my
            first job out
            of college in Big Tech has been challenging for me. I've been asking myself more and more: "What kind of
            person
            do I want to
            be?" and "How do I want to contribute to society?"
        </p>
        <p>
            And many times I've said to myself: "Can I act like the
            people I admire while contributing to a system that doesn't align with my politics?"

            Protests following the murder of George Floyd has forced a national reckoning on race in america.

        <p>
            The movement has also forced a personal reckoning on race: how I see race, how others see my race, and how I
            see my race.
